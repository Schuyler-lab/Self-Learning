## Self-Learning

The main purpose of this repository is to help me get a bit more comfortable working with Git. In the future, I may also elect to upload some projects I'm working on for my own learning.

### Update: January 22

I created this repository about a month ago, and am revisiting it in conjunction with one of the Coursera courses I'm working my way through.
